# 1. Overview

The VAST Challenge 2021 is a rerun of the VAST Challenge 2014 with the same story line about the fictitious island country of Kronos, the company GASTech, and the incidents involving missing GAStech employees. However, the data for the VAST Challenge 2021 were modified and new questions were introduced.  

Using the two weeks worth of data leading to the disappearance of the GAStech employees, the goal of Mini-Challenge 2 is to analyze the movement and tracking of company vehicles GPS data. Additionally, together with GAStech employeeâ€™s credit card transactions and Kronos Kares loyalty card data, the main objectives are:

- Identify anomalies and suspicious behaviours

- Identify which people use which credit card and loyalty cards

# 2. Literature Review

## 2.1 Data Understanding

The 2021 data was compared against 2014 data using the _diffr_ package to better understand the variations of VAST Challenge 2021 from the previous year's challenge. 

- _car-assignments.csv_ contains vehicle assignments by employee. It lists the employee name, Car ID assignment, employee department, and employee job title.

  + Based on the result of code chunk below, all employee names are the same. However, there are 8 employees with different car ID assignment and employee job title. For example, _Calixto,Nils_ was assigned to _CardID 1_ as _IT Helpdesk_ in 2021 challenge but was previously assigned to _CardID 8_ as _IT Technician_ in 2014 challenge.

```{r diff car, eval = FALSE}
library(diffr)
diffr("data/aspatial/car-assignments.csv", "data_2014/aspatial/car-assignments.csv")
```
![](img/diff_car.png)

- _loyalty_data.csv_ contains the loyalty card transaction data. It lists the date of the transaction, name of the business, price, and the unique 5-character code loyalty number.

  + The major difference in VAST Challenge 2021 is that loyalty number was used instead of employee names. Other minor differences are the date format ( _line:2_ **0**1/**0**6/2014 vs 1/6/2014) and price of transaction ( example: _line:1145_ Hippokampos,**14.89** vs. Hippokampos,**17.66**).

```{r diff loyal, eval = FALSE}
diffr("data/aspatial/loyalty_data.csv", "data_2014/aspatial/loyalty_data.csv")
```
![](img/diff_loyalty.png)

- _cc_data.csv_ contains the credit and debit card transaction data. It lists the date and time of the transaction, name of the business, price, and last 4 digits of the credit or debit card number.

  + Similar to the loyalty data, the major difference in that last 4 digits was used instead of employee names. Other minor differences are the date and time format ( _line:2_ **0**1/**0**6/2014 07:28 vs 1/6/2014 7:28) as well as the time and price of transaction ( example: _line:701_ 01/12/2014 **13:17**,Ouzeri Elian,**98.45**  vs. 1/12/2014 **13:03**,Ouzeri Elian,**38.5**).


```{r diff cc, eval = FALSE}
diffr("data/aspatial/cc_data.csv", "data_2014/aspatial/cc_data.csv")
```

![](img/diff_cc.png){width=80%}

- _gps.csv_ contains the vehicle tracking data. It lists the date and time, car ID, latitude, and longitude coordinates with *685,170* entries. 

  + The file size is too large and it is not practical to do a line by line comparison. Instead of using the _diffr_ , the _md5sum_ was used to compute the MD5 hashes and detect if there are differences between the 2 files. Based on the result of code chunk below, there are no differences between the 2021 and 2014 gps.csv file.

```{r diff gps}
library(tools)
md5sum("data/aspatial/gps.csv") == md5sum("data_2014/aspatial/gps.csv")
```
- _MC2-Tourist.jpg_ is the tourist map of Abila, the Capital city of Kronos, with identified location of interest. 

  + Based on visual inspection and _md5sum_ code chunk below, there are no differences between the 2021 and 2014 tourist map.

```{r diff map}
md5sum("data/aspatial/MC2-tourist.jpg") == md5sum("data_2014/aspatial/MC2-tourist.jpg")
```
- _ESRI shapefiles_ of Abila and Kronos contains the geospatial vector data format for storing geometric location and associated attribute information.

  + Based on the _md5sum_ code chunk below, there are also no differences between the 2021 and 2014 shapefiles.

```{r diff shapefiles}
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Abila.dbf") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Abila.dbf")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Abila.kml") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Abila.kml")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Abila.prj") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Abila.prj")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Abila.sbn") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Abila.sbn")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Abila.sbx") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Abila.sbx")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Abila.shp") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Abila.shp")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Abila.shx") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Abila.shx")

md5sum("data/Geospatial/Kronos Island.kmz") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Kronos Island.kmz")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.dbf") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.dbf")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.prj") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.prj")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.sbn") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.sbn")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.sbx") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.sbx")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.shp") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.shp")
md5sum("data/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.shx") == md5sum("data_2014/Geospatial/Kronos_Island.shx")
```
## 2.2 Guide Questions

VAST Challenge 2014 focuses about 'Patterns of Life' analysis. It asked about the common daily routines of GAStech employees and what does a day in the life of typical GAStech employee look like.  

In contrast, VAST Challenge 2021 asks to infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card since the employee names were replaced by  last 4 digits of the credit or debit card number and unique 5-character code loyalty number.

Nevertheless, both challenges want to know about _unusual events_, _anomalies_, and _evidences of suspicious activities_.

## 2.3 Visualisation Approaches

By reviewing the submissions for [VAST Challenge 2014](http://visualdata.wustl.edu/varepository/VAST%20Challenge%202014/challenges/MC2%20-%20Patterns%20of%20Life%20Analysis/), several approaches were identified to be relevant to the current VAST challenge and reproducible using R data visualisation and data analysis packages.

Mini-Challenge 2 emphasizes the geospatial-temporal data analysis with the financial data from the credit card and loyalty transactions. The common approach from several submissions was to highlight roadway paths of the car and indicate the position and time relationship. The figure below from the [Peking University](http://visualdata.wustl.edu/varepository/VAST%20Challenge%202014/challenges/MC2%20-%20Patterns%20of%20Life%20Analysis/entries/Peking%20University/), recipient of Excellent Comprehensive Visual Analysis System Award, shows an example geospatial-temporal visualisation.

![](img/litreview_01_peking.png)

This example of movement data visualisation can be achieved using _sf_, _raster_, _readr_, _clock_ and _tmap_ packages. It can also be improved by having an interactive map and tooltip information.

The heatmap visualisation below from [Central South University](http://visualdata.wustl.edu/varepository/VAST%20Challenge%202014/challenges/MC2%20-%20Patterns%20of%20Life%20Analysis/entries/Central%20South%20University/), recipient of Outstanding Visualization and Analysis Award, shows the credit card transactions of general staff which can also be used to identify the most popular spots and when they are popular. 
![](img/litreview_02_central_south.jpg){width=80%}

This example of heatmap visualisation can be achieved using _gglot2_ and _plotly_ packages. It can also be improved by having an interactive tooltip information.

The concept of 'Point of Interest' (POI) from [Virginia Tech](http://visualdata.wustl.edu/varepository/VAST%20Challenge%202014/challenges/MC2%20-%20Patterns%20of%20Life%20Analysis/entries/Virginia%20Tech/), recipient of Effective Presentation Honorable Mention, shows the location with a diameter of 50 meters where an employee stops for more than 5 minutes. The POI concept can be utilized to correlate the gps tracking data, credit and debit card transactions, and loyalty card data to help in identifying the owners of the credit card and loyalty cards.

![](img/litreview_03_virginia.jpg)

This example of POI data visualisation can be achieved by reusing the geospatial-temporal packages.

# 3. Methodology

## 3.1 Install and Lauch R Packages

The code chunk below is used to install and load the packages.

```{r r package}
packages = c('ggiraph', 'plotly',
             'raster','sf', 'tmap', 
             'igraph', 'tidygraph', 
             'ggraph', 'visNetwork', 
             'lubridate', 'clock',
             'widyr', 'wordcloud',
             'ggwordcloud', 'DT',
             'textplot', 'hms',
             'timetk','tidyverse')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```
Aside from the mentioned packages in the Literature Review, the following packages are also loaded:

- _igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, visNetwork_ for creation of graph object data frames and building network graph visualisation

- _timetk_ for the visualization, wrangling and feature engineering of time series data and to diagnose anomalies


## 3.2 Import Data

Using _read_csv()_ of readr package, import the csv files into R.

```{r}
car_data <- read_csv("data/aspatial/car-assignments.csv")
cc_data <- read_csv("data/aspatial/cc_data.csv")
loyalty_data <- read_csv("data/aspatial/loyalty_data.csv")
gps_data <- read_csv("data/aspatial/gps.csv")

glimpse(car_data)
glimpse(cc_data)
glimpse(loyalty_data)
glimpse(gps_data)
```

Using an external open-source geographic information system (GIS) software _[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/)_, produce a georeference tif file called **abila_map.tif** from the tourist map _MC2-Tourist.jpg_ and _Abila_ shapefiles.

![](img/qgis_map.png)

Using _raster()_ of Raster package, import _abila_map.tif_ into R.

```{r}
bgmap <- raster("data/Geospatial/abila_map.tif")

tm_shape(bgmap) +
tm_rgb(bgmap, r = 1,g = 2,b = 3,
       alpha = NA,
       saturation = 1,
       interpolate = TRUE,
       max.value = 255)
```

## 3.3 Prepare Data

- _car_data_

There are several employees with the same last name and same first name.
Create a new column _FullName_ and combine _FirstName_ and _LastName_ to have unique employee name identifier.
Additionally, rename columns _CurrentEmploymentType_ to _Department_ and _CurrentEmploymentTitle_ to _Title_.

```{r}
car_data <- car_data %>%
  mutate(FullName = paste(FirstName, LastName, sep = " ")) %>%
  rename(Deparment = CurrentEmploymentType) %>%
  rename(Title = CurrentEmploymentTitle)
```

- _cc_data_

_Katerina's Cafe'_ causes error when plotting a graph because of special characters.
Convert the special characters into string format using _mutate_ and _str_detec_ functions.

```{r}
cc_data <- cc_data %>%
    mutate(location = ifelse(str_detect(location, "Katerina"), "Katerina's Cafe", location))
```
